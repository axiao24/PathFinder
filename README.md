# PathFinder Visualizer
This program illustrates the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for discovering the shortest path. It visually represents the starting and ending points, queued and visited nodes, and highlights the optimal path to the target node. Developed using Python and Pygame, the program offers a real-time, step-by-step visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm execution.
